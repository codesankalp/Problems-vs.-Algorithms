TrieNode:

Insert a character: Time complexity - O(1) ; space complexity : O(1) 
uffixes of a node: Time complexity: O(m*n) ; space complexity : O(m*n)
where m is maximum number of elements one level can have & n is the number of levels.

Trie:

Insert a word: Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n)

Find a prefix: Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(1)
